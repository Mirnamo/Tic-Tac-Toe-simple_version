# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Simple version in command line)

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe written in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O'). The first player to form a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
